# 🩺 Medical Pneumonia Prediction (Streamlit App)

This is a **Streamlit-based web application** that predicts whether a person has **Pneumonia** based on medical data (such as chest X-rays or clinical parameters).  
The project uses **Machine Learning / Deep Learning** models for classification and provides an easy-to-use interface for healthcare insights.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 📊 Upload chest X-ray images (or enter patient data)
- 🤖 Predict Pneumonia using a trained ML/DL model
- 🌐 Interactive UI built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
- 📈 Visualization of results & model confidence

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nikhita-14/Medical-Pneumonia-Prediction.git
cd Medical-Pneumonia-Prediction
```
2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
```bash
